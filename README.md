# Kast

Kast is a simple yet powerful DLNA control tool. It is completely cross-platform; Linux, Windows and Android are officially supported.

It is written in C++ and QML and relies on Qt framework where possible.

**WARNING!**  Kast is a work in progress, and although it is developed very rapidly, it is far from its release state yet.
